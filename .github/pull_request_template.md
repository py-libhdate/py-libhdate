When opening the PR, your commit messages for a given branch will automatically be
added to the CHANGELOG. Please keep it clear. You can prepend the summary with ``chg``,
``fix`` or ``new`` to insert the message in the correct category.
Adding ``!minor`` or ``!cosmetics`` will cause the commit not to be noted in the
changelog.
