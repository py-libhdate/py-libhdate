Development guidelines
======================

Creating a dev environment
--------------------------

Create your personal fork of the project.
After cloning the environment ...

.. code :: shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:<your username>/py-libhdate.git

create virtual environment ...

.. code :: shell

   $ python3 -m venv hdate
   $ cd hdate
   $ . bin/activate

and install the package as editable:

.. code :: shell

   $ pip install -e .[dev]

At this point you should install the pre-commit hooks so your commits match those in
the project:

.. code :: shell

   $ pre-commit install

Create your topic branch

.. code :: shell

   $ git branch -b <topic>

Now you're ready to write you're code.
Once the code is ready ...

.. code :: shell

   $ tox

If tox passes, you're ready to create a pull request.

**Note:** the first commit might take some time while pre-commit installs the needed
dependencies.

**Important:** Your first commit message for a given branch will automatically be
added to the CHANGELOG. Please keep it clear. You can prepend the summary with ``chg``,
``fix`` or ``new`` to insert the message in the correct category.
Adding ``!minor`` or ``!cosmetics`` will cause the commit not to be noted in the
changelog.
