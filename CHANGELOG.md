## 0.9.0 - 2019-08-06

* Accept timezone aware datetime as an argument to Zmanim. @tsvi
* Move from dateutil to pytz. @tsvi
  
  dateutil requires the system to have timezone files. When homeassistant runs
  as a docker image these are not available, and timezone is set to tzlocal().
  
  To handle the timezones properly we're moving to use pytz instead
  
* Remove pylintrc from manifest. @tsvi
* Add logging and comments to zmanim. @tsvi
* Refactor utc_minute_timezone method as utc_zmanim dictionary. @tsvi
  
  The UTC zmanim dictionary holds the zmanim in UTC format

  HDates. @arigilder

## 0.8.4 - 2018-12-09

* Revert greedy removal of pylint warning. @tsvi
  
  For class inheritance to work correctly under python 2, we need BaseClass to
  inherit from object. Therefore we also need to add the pylint disabling of
  useless-object-inheritance.
  
  Python 2 tests pass now.

## 0.8.3 - 2018-12-09

* Remove and update pylint warnings. @tsvi
  
  Some warnings are for Python 2.7 only. As long as the code runs on Python2.7 we don't care
  about the linter warnings. They are tested w.r.t. Python 3.
  
  Also add six dependency, and disable TODO warnings in pylint.
  
  When running pylint on it's own it should get caught.
  
* Merge pull request #34 from arigilder/upcoming_shabbat. @tsvi
  
  A few lint fixes I forgot to commit
  
* A few lint fixes I forgot to commit. @arigilder

* Add enums for Months and other cleanup. @arigilder
* Give the sources for the Zmanim calculations in the docstrings. @tsvi
  
## 0.8.2 - 2018-11-25

* Change and add erev chagim to all be of holiday_type == 2. @tsvi
  
  Erev shavuot had a holiday type of 9 which doesn't match other holiday_type 9.
  Other chagim didn't have any erev chagim specified except for erev yom kippur
  which was holiday_type 2.
  
  Unfortuantely with the current code, this doesn't simplify the check for issur_melacha
  as in the case of diaspora the first day yom tov is holiday_type 1, maybe holiday type
  should be a list instead of an int. Call it holiday properties. This would allow
  hoshana raba to be defined as chol hamoed, erev yom tov and special.
  
* Add support for setting the shabbes offset. @tsvi
  
## 0.8.1 - 2018-11-22

* Remove holiday indices as they're superfluous. @tsvi
  
  The old system used indices to lookup properties baout the holidays. As holidays
  are now defined by namedtuples, there's no point in storing indices or using them as
  "magic numbers".
  
  The only place where the indices were used in the code were tests, so the test have
  been updated accordingly.
  
* Add direct tests on conversion methods to get better test coverage.
  @tsvi
  
* Rename test variables. @tsvi
* Add converters test file. @tsvi
* Test with correct holiday name spelling. @tsvi
* Improve coverage and simplify some tests. @tsvi
* Implement  a placeholder for the **unicode** method of BaseClass
  objects. @tsvi
  
* Some more code deduplication. @tsvi
* Remove duplicate code. @tsvi
* Fix flake8 errors. @tsvi
* Reorder imports according to isort rules. @tsvi
* Add test for typerror case for Zmanim. @tsvi
* Cause check to run with python 3.6 on travis. @tsvi
* Add tests for erev shaabat and erev Yom tov. @tsvi
* Should cause Travis to run linters as well. @tsvi
* Fix double negation in inequality testing. @tsvi
* Return the copied object not the generator. @tsvi
* Fix fixture not returning internal function. @tsvi
* Fix original not passed to deepcopy fixture. @tsvi
* Fixes missing fixture statement. @tsvi
* Fixes common tests. @tsvi
* Consolidate tests. @tsvi
* Implement **repr** function for Zmanim and Location objects. @tsvi
  
* Print the seconds output for zmanim. @tsvi
  
  This simplifies the logic for printing the Zmanim object as a
  string.
  BREAKING CHANGE
  
* Fix test passing although not testing. @tsvi
* Improve test coverage for edge cases. @tsvi
* Add test for repr implementation and fix implementation. @tsvi

## 0.8.0 - 2018-11-12

* Fix tox.ini to allow running specific tests via tox. @tsvi
* Implement tests and fix bugs for issur_melacha_in_effect. @tsvi
  
* Add Zmanim property for issur_melacha. @tsvi
* Remov unnecessary typechecking. Not pythonic. @tsvi
* When printing the HDate represantation, return the gdate `repr` @tsvi
  
* Zmanim should simply be a property, that way no assignment of
  get_zmanim is necessary. @tsvi
* Move utc_minute_timezone to be closer to othe code calulcations. @tsvi
* Move type checking to property setters. @tsvi
  
  Not really sure about this, as it inflates the code.
  
* Remove the Zmanim object from the HDate object. @tsvi
  
  Based on some discussion I read this would not be healthy as it creates a G-D object.
  A smarter move would be instead to create either a third class that would wrap both, or else
  even better might be to create a property that would instantiate a zmanim object and check
  the given time in relationship to the times from the Zmanim object.
  
  Another option would be to create it as a property of the Zmanim object which would instantiate
  a HDate object.
  
* Add docstrings and pylint disable warnings. @tsvi
* Breaking change: Update README example and update the test
  accordingly. @tsvi
* Change Location from namedtuple into a proper class. @tsvi
* Get most tests to pass. @tsvi
* Fix cyclic dependency. @tsvi
  
  This commit causes the tests to run again. Doesn't pass yet.
  
* Move `get_zmanim_string` to be the implementation of `__unicode__`  of
  the Zmanim object. @tsvi
  
* Use a dict comprehension for get_zmanim() @tsvi
  
  was using a combersome method of creating two dictionaries. The first one
  to get the values in  UTC time, and the second one to 'massage' the values into the local
  time for the given keys.
  
  This change simplifies the method by using a dict_comprehension instead.
  
* Initial work. @tsvi
